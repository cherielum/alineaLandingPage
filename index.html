            Dining at Alinea is not only delicious, but also fun, emotional, and provocative. After a complete renovation in 2016, Alinea now features three unique and distinct experiences: The Gallery, The Salons, and the Kitchen Table. Alinea has been universally praised for its innovative approach to modernist cuisine. It has four times been named the Best Restaurant in America and is one of only 13 restaurants in the U.S. to earn the coveted Michelin 3-Star rating.
